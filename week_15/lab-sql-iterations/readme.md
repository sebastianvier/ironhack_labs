# Lab | SQL Iterations

In this lab, we will continue working on the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. 

### Instructions

Write queries to answer the following questions:

- Write a query to find what is the total business done by each store.
- Convert the previous query into a stored procedure.
- Convert the previous query into a stored procedure that takes the input for `store_id` and displays the *total sales for that store*.
- Update the previous query. Declare a variable `total_sales_value` of float type, that will store the returned result (of the total sales amount for the store). Call the stored procedure and print the results.
- In the previous query, add another variable `flag`. If the total sales value for the store is over 30.000, then label it as `green_flag`, otherwise label is as `red_flag`. Update the stored procedure that takes an input as the `store_id` and returns total sales value for that store and flag value.
